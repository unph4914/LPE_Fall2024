### Additional Notes for Verification

- **Scope Screenshots**: For each power rail, communication bus, and major signal, capture scope screenshots for inclusion in the final report to document measured voltages, currents, and signal quality.
- **Test Equipment**: Plan to use an oscilloscope, multimeter, and power supply for precise measurements during verification.
- **Testing Responsibilities**: Designate team members for each testing task to ensure accountability and streamlined completion.
- **Documentation**: Capture detailed notes, screenshots, and test configurations for any items that do not pass initially, along with corrective actions taken.
