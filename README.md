**Overview**:
This project aims to design and develop a low-power gaming application using two Blue Gecko microcontrollers (MCUs) from Silicon Labs, leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. The project will involve creating a complete gaming system, where one microcontroller (Stick Gecko) acts as the BLE transmitter interfaced with various sensors and input devices, and the other microcontroller (Screen Gecko) acts as the BLE receiver, interfaced with a display to run the game application.

**System Description**
*Stick Gecko (BLE Transmitter)* uses ARM Cortex-M4 core

Components:

- Joystic, Buttons, Gyro Sensor, Temperature Sensor, Li-Ion Battery, Solar Panel, & BLE Communication.


*Screen Gecko (BLE Receiver)* uses ARM Cortex-M4 core

Components:

- OLED Display, Li-Ion Battery, Solar Panel, Ambient Light Sensor, Buttons, & BLE Communication.
